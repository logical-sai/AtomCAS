WELCOME TO: AtomCAS
Built on one philosophy: No rounding, ever.

Hello, visitor. It appears you come here to investigate this class. Classic old thing
that's been around since the dawn of computing. But that's not the point. This comment,
despite its tone, serves only to list possible outputs that can come out of certain inputs.
If you refuse to follow any of these then enjoy your "perfect" all-nighter.
RULES TO FOLLOW

SCALARS & SCALARS
LargeInteger + LargeInteger = LargeInteger;
LargeInteger - LargeInteger = LargeInteger;
LargeInteger * LargeInteger = LargeInteger;
LargeInteger / LargeInteger = LargeFraction; (unless you use the integer division method, then
you get LargeInteger. But who even does that?)
LargeInteger ^ LargeInteger = LargeInteger or LargeFraction; (LargeFraction if exponent is negative.
That's properties of exponents for you.)
LargeFraction + LargeFraction = LargeFraction;
LargeFraction - LargeFraction = LargeFraction;
LargeFraction * LargeFraction = LargeFraction;
LargeFraction / LargeFraction = LargeFraction;
LargeFraction ^ LargeFraction = LargePowerMonomial or LargeFraction; (RadicalTerms are a thing.
Oh, you forgot they were? Your middle school math teacher must be extremely proud of you.)

SCALARS AND TENSORS
Scalar × Vector → Vector; (commutative property of multiplication.)
Scalar × Matrix → Matrix; (commutative property of multiplication AGAIN.)

TENSORS AND TENSORS
Vector + Vector -> Vector; (look at that. Quite the satisfaction.)
Matrix + Matrix -> Matrix; (it happened again. The math gods are playing nice.)
Matrix × Vector → Vector; (it feels wrong, I know. But it comes from dot products. Don't worry
you'll get used to it.)
Matrix × Matrix → Matrix (this...I don't have to explain.)

LAYERS/MODELS
Layer applied to Vector → Vector(it's a small step in gradient descent. Learn neural networking.)
Layer × Layer → maybe composition, maybe forbidden; (do not question these. Not yet.)

WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THESE
Vector + Scalar → probably forbidden; (Do not question these guys back here. It's for your own good.)
Vector + Matrix -> forbiden... (You sure you wanna go with this?)
Exponentiation on Tensors → probably forbidden unless special cases

THE SUMMARY
When performing an operation, if the result leaves a certain family, promote to the next layer that
can still represent the result. At least, if that is possible.
